# Analyze Tool

Systematic code analysis through step-by-step investigation. Examines architecture, performance, security, and code quality patterns.

## Thinking Mode

Default: `medium` (8,192 tokens). Use `high` for architecture analysis or `low` for quick overviews.

## Workflow

**Investigation Phase:**
1. Claude plans analysis and examines code structure
2. Investigates patterns, dependencies, design decisions
3. Tracks findings and confidence levels
4. Signals completion when comprehensive

**Expert Analysis Phase:**
Provides final assessment with strategic recommendations (skipped if confidence is `certain`).

## Example Prompts

**Basic Usage:**
```
"Use gemini to analyze main.py to understand how it works"
"Get gemini to do an architecture analysis of the src/ directory"
```

## Features

- Analyzes files or directories
- Analysis types: architecture, performance, security, quality, general
- Identifies patterns and refactoring opportunities
- Handles large codebases with 1M token models
- Maps cross-file dependencies
- Image support for diagrams
- Web search for documentation (default: enabled)

- `thinking_mode`: minimal|low|medium|high|max (default: medium, Gemini only)
- `use_websearch`: Enable web search for documentation and best practices (default: true)
- `use_assistant_model`: Whether to use expert analysis phase (default: true, set to false to use Claude only)
- `continuation_id`: Continue previous analysis sessions

## Analysis Types

**General (default):** Code structure, components, data flow, patterns

**Architecture:** System design, dependencies, coupling, scalability

**Performance:** Bottlenecks, complexity, memory, I/O efficiency

**Security:** Vulnerabilities, validation, authentication
- Data protection and privacy considerations

**Quality Analysis:**
- Code quality metrics and maintainability
- Testing coverage and patterns
- Documentation completeness
- Best practices adherence

## Usage Examples

**Single File Analysis:**
```
"Analyze user_controller.py to understand the authentication flow with gemini"
```

**Directory Architecture Analysis:**
```
"Use pro to analyze the src/ directory architecture and identify the main components"
```

**Performance-Focused Analysis:**
```
"Analyze backend/api/ for performance bottlenecks with o3, focus on database queries"
```

**Security Assessment:**
```
"Use gemini pro to analyze the authentication module for security patterns and potential issues"
```

**Visual + Code Analysis:**
```
"Analyze this system architecture diagram along with the src/core/ implementation to understand the data flow"
```

**Large Codebase Analysis:**
```
"Analyze the entire project structure with gemini pro to understand how all components work together"
```

## Output Formats

**Summary Format:**
- High-level overview with key findings
- Main components and their purposes
- Critical insights and recommendations

**Detailed Format (default):**
- Comprehensive analysis with specific examples
- Code snippets and file references
- Detailed explanations of patterns and structures

**Actionable Format:**
- Specific recommendations and next steps
- Prioritized list of improvements
- Implementation guidance and examples


## Advanced Features

**Large Codebase Support:**
With models like Gemini Pro (1M context), you can analyze extensive codebases:
```
"Analyze the entire microservices architecture across all service directories"
```

**Cross-File Relationship Mapping:**
Understand how components interact across multiple files:
```
"Analyze the data processing pipeline across input/, processing/, and output/ directories"
```

**Pattern Recognition:**
Identify design patterns, anti-patterns, and architectural decisions:
```
"Analyze src/ to identify all design patterns used and assess their implementation quality"
```

**Web Search Enhancement:**
The tool can recommend searches for current best practices and documentation:
```
After analysis: "Recommended searches for Claude: 'FastAPI async best practices 2024', 'SQLAlchemy ORM performance optimization patterns'"
```

## When to Use Analyze vs Other Tools

- **Use `analyze`** for: Understanding code structure, exploring unfamiliar codebases, architecture assessment
- **Use `codereview`** for: Finding bugs and security issues with actionable fixes
- **Use `debug`** for: Diagnosing specific runtime errors or performance problems
- **Use `refactor`** for: Getting specific refactoring recommendations and implementation plans
- **Use `chat`** for: Open-ended discussions about code without structured analysis
