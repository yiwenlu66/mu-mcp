# PreCommit Tool

Validates git changes before committing. Reviews staged/unstaged changes for quality and regressions.

## Thinking Mode

Default: `medium` (8,192 tokens). Use `high` or `max` for critical releases.

## Workflow

**Investigation Phase (Minimum 3 steps):**
1. Claude states validation strategy
2. Examines changes, diffs, dependencies
3. Performs final verification
4. Creates changeset file for external validation

**Expert Validation Phase:**
Provides issue assessment and commit recommendations (skipped if precommit_type is `internal`).

**Notes:**
- Default: external validation (uses expert model)
- Minimum 3 steps enforced
- Creates zen_precommit.changeset for external validation

## Model Recommendation

Gemini Pro recommended for analyzing extensive changesets and cross-file dependencies.

## Visual Example

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/584adfa6-d252-49b4-b5b0-0cd6e97fb2c6" width="950">
</div>

**Prompt Used:**
```
Now use gemini and perform a review and precommit and ensure original requirements are met, no duplication of code or
logic, everything should work as expected
```

How beautiful is that? Claude used `precommit` twice and `codereview` once and actually found and fixed two critical errors before commit!

### Real-world Example

Here's an example where Claude was made to go through changes *it* was asked to make. Its recommendation 
to **Publish all Changes** was made after a rigorous set of prompts where it examined the small set of changes 
from different angles (performance, bugs, anti-patterns etc). After confirming that unit tests were 
passing, it went ahead with an initial review with O3; came back clean - all good to go. O3 was happy, everything looked great.

Then it shared the changes and relevant code with Gemini 2.5 Pro - the following is the outcome:

```
⏺ zen:precommit (MCP)(step: "FINAL VALIDATION COMPLETE. All changes have been thoroughly analyzed and are ready for
                     commit. The modifications successfully fix 4 GitHub CI test failures with high-quality, defensive

⏺ 🔍 Pre-Commit Validation Complete

  Based on comprehensive analysis using both O3 and Gemini 2.5 Pro models, I can provide the following assessment:

  ✅ APPROVED WITH CRITICAL FIX REQUIRED

  The changes successfully fix all 4 GitHub CI test failures and are well-implemented with defensive programming
  patterns. However, the expert analysis identified one critical issue that must be addressed before commit:

  🚨 [HIGH PRIORITY] Critical Issue Found

  Inconsistent Provider Handling in tools/base.py
  - Location: tools/base.py line ~1833 in _create_continuation_offer_response method
  - Problem: The defensive provider handling pattern was applied in 2 locations but missed a 3rd location
  - Impact: Risk of AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'get_provider_type' in continuation scenarios
  - Fix Required: Apply the same defensive pattern to the missed location
```

A subtle but critical issue spotted by Gemini that both Claude + O3 missed. This is the power of running these workflows with Zen.

## Example Prompts

```
Use zen and perform a thorough precommit ensuring there aren't any new regressions or bugs introduced
```

## Key Features

- **Recursive repository discovery** - finds all git repos including nested ones
- **Validates changes against requirements** - ensures implementation matches intent
- **Detects incomplete changes** - finds added functions never called, missing tests, etc.
- **Multi-repo support** - reviews changes across multiple repositories in one go
- **Configurable scope** - review staged, unstaged, or compare against branches
- **Security focused** - catches exposed secrets, vulnerabilities in new code
- **Smart truncation** - handles large diffs without exceeding context limits
- **Cross-file dependency analysis** - identifies breaking changes across modules
- **Test coverage validation** - ensures new code has appropriate test coverage
- **Regression detection** - compares against requirements to prevent scope creep

## Usage Examples

**Basic Pre-commit Validation:**
```
"Use zen precommit to validate my changes before committing"
```

**Security-Focused Validation:**
```
"Perform precommit security review with gemini pro on the authentication changes"
```

**Multi-Repository Validation:**
```
"Validate changes across all repositories in this workspace with o3"
```

**Against Specific Branch:**
```
"Compare current changes against main branch with precommit using gemini pro"
```

**With Requirements Context:**
```
"Precommit validation ensuring the new payment feature meets requirements in FEATURE_SPEC.md"
```

## Validation Scope

The tool automatically discovers and validates:

**Repository Discovery:**
- Searches recursively for all `.git` directories
- Handles nested repositories and submodules
- Configurable search depth to prevent excessive recursion

**Change Analysis:**
- Staged changes (`git diff --cached`)
- Unstaged changes (`git diff`)
- Untracked files that should be added
- Deleted files and their impact

**Cross-Repository Impact:**
- Shared dependencies between repositories
- API contract changes that affect other repos
- Configuration changes with system-wide impact

## Validation Categories

**Completeness Checks:**
- New functions/classes have corresponding tests
- Documentation updated for API changes
- Configuration files updated as needed
- Migration scripts for database changes

**Quality Assurance:**
- Code follows project standards
- No obvious bugs or logical errors
- Performance implications considered
- Security vulnerabilities addressed

**Requirement Compliance:**
- Implementation matches original requirements
- No scope creep or unauthorized changes
- All acceptance criteria met
- Edge cases properly handled

**Integration Safety:**
- Breaking changes properly documented
- Backward compatibility maintained where required
- Dependencies correctly updated
- Environment-specific changes validated


## Output Format

Validation results include:
- **Change Summary**: Overview of what was modified across repositories
- **Requirement Compliance**: How well changes match original intent
- **Completeness Assessment**: Missing tests, documentation, or related changes
- **Security Review**: Potential vulnerabilities or exposed secrets
- **Integration Impact**: Cross-repository and cross-module effects
- **Recommendations**: Specific actions before committing

## When to Use PreCommit vs Other Tools

- **Use `precommit`** for: Validating changes before git commit, ensuring requirement compliance
- **Use `codereview`** for: General code quality assessment without git context
- **Use `debug`** for: Diagnosing specific runtime issues
- **Use `analyze`** for: Understanding existing code without validation context
